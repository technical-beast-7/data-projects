The netflix_titles.csv dataset was cleaned and preprocessed using the following steps:

Removed duplicate rows to ensure data consistency.

Renamed column headers to a clean, lowercase, underscore-separated format.

Converted the date_added column to datetime format for temporal analysis.

Standardized text fields like type, country, and rating (trimmed spaces, title case).

Handled missing values.

Ensured all data types are appropriate for analysis (e.g., release_year as int, date_added as datetime).
